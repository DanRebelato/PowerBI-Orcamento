## 🧩 About the Data

> ⚠️ Due to confidentiality reasons, the original data used in this project is not available for review or sharing.

The Excel dataset used in this dashboard was generated through a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, including:

- Extraction of raw data via SAP, from different modules and operational reports;  
- Data cleaning and merging with internal supporting spreadsheets using Excel;  
- Final consolidation into a single file, which served as the foundation for data modeling and visualization in Power BI.

Although the intermediate and original files are not included in this repository, the current structure faithfully simulates the logic and context of the original project.

- Power BI Desktop  
- Excel (preliminary processing and Power BI source)
